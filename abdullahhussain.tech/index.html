		            	I was an English, Maths and 11+ Tutor for children aged 4-14. <p></p>

		            	<p></p>
						Was a lead on the 11+ courses, planning for the year 4 and year 5 11+ sessions.  It involved liaising with the other tutors and discussing the content.  Making sure we stick to the allocated timeframe, marking homework and tests.  Doing a fun mini presentation summarising the session to the parents and children.

The aim of the project was to develop a program that would anonymise sensitive C3 level data from a CSV file so that it could be safely uploaded onto GCP(for data analytics purposes), which is in the public domain. <b></b>

							The program uses a GUI which allows the user to upload a CSV file, Click a button which anonymise the contents and store the anonymised contents within an array. The program made sure to allocate the same values with the same value, E.g. if the users location was newbury, then that would be assigned the same value for all newbury cases. There is also a feature to write anonymised contents to a file.

                  Abdullah is very reliable and hardworking. As well as tutoring Maths and English he took on a lead role in the preparation of our eleven plus course. He shows a lot of initiative and is very mature in everything he does. We were truly sad to hear that Abdullah was leaving as he worked so well with everybody in the team. I would really recommend hiring Abdullah for future vacancies, he has been a fantastic role model for new staff as well as the children he tutored.
